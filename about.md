I am a software engineer working at [Algonyx](http://algonyx.com). I have graduated from [Shahjalal University
of Science and Technology](http://www.sust.edu/) in computer science and engineering. I am an open source
enthusiast and I love github for this. In this blog I have used theme [lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). Follow me in twitter: [@salman_wahed](https://twitter.com/salman_wahed).
